* Clojurescript build instructions
Currently the clojurescript build isn't working the way I think it should, see [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39397638/clojurescript-duplicate-extern-input-error]]. Instead, I have a workaround described below.
- git clone [[https://github.com/archlisp/screeps-beans][screeps-beans]] to the same directory as this my-screeps directory. (so if you do "ls ../" from the directory containing this readme you should see both)
- Checkout the remove_extern branch in screeps-beans
- Run "lein install" in screeps-beans
- Run ./scripts/release in my-screeps
- You should now have a file release/main.js which has your program in it.
